# ðŸ’° Wallet API

A simple wallet management API built using **Go (Gin framework)** and **PostgreSQL**, providing basic functionality for withdrawing funds from a userâ€™s account.  
The project includes **database migrations with seed data**, making it easy to start testing right after setup.

## ðŸ“Œ Assumptions

- Users already exist in the system (seeded during migration).
- Withdrawals are only allowed if the user has sufficient balance.
- Transactions are immediately marked as completed for simplicity.
- No user registration/login flow is implemented for now â€” focus is on withdrawal logic.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Process Flow

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Download the project from GitHub to your local machine.

2. **Install Dependencies**
   - Vendor dependencies with `go mod vendor` and clean up with `go mod tidy`.

3. **Setup Environment**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust variables according to your setup (local PostgreSQL or Docker PostgreSQL).

4. **Prepare Database**
   - Create the database in PostgreSQL (`wallet_db` by default).
   - The app uses **golang-migrate** for migrations and **sqlc** to generate SQL queries.
   - Migrations run automatically when the app starts.
   - **Seed data** for `user` table is included, so you can directly perform withdrawals.

5. **Run the Application**
   - Start the app with:
     ```bash
     go run cmd/main.go
     ```

6. **Test APIs**
   - Use **Postman** or any API client to test endpoints.
   - Example: `POST /withdraw` with an existing seeded user ID.

## ðŸ”® Limitations & Future Improvements

- **Authentication & Authorization**
  - Implement JWT with Bearer tokens for all API endpoints.

- **Withdraw Transaction Handling**
  - Add rollback mechanism for failed withdrawals.
  - Implement idempotency to prevent duplicate withdrawals.
  - Add rate limiting for withdrawals.

- **Environments**
  - Separate configuration for development, staging, and production.

- **Testing & CI/CD*
  - Unit tests for controller and service layers.
  - GitHub Actions workflow for build & test.

- **Deployment**
  - Dockerfile for containerization.
  - Kubernetes manifests for deployment.

- **Monitoring**
  - Currently only basic logging; can be improved with Prometheus & Grafana.
 
- **Error Handling**
  - Could be enhanced with better structured error responses.

- **Feature Enhancements**
  - Expand transaction status (pending, refund, canceled, failed).
  - Integrate third-party payment gateways.
  - Prevent withdrawals when balance is zero (backend & frontend validation).

---

## ðŸ“¦ Note

When the application runs migrations, it automatically:
1. Creates required tables.
2. Inserts seed data into the user table.
   
This means you can call the withdraw API immediately with a seeded user_id.
